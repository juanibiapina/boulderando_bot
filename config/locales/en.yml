    Hi,

    I can help you automatically book bouldering sessions in several Gyms. By using this service you agree with our privacy policy, which you can check by typing /privacy_policy .

    This is your personal registration link: %{registration_link}

    After registering with this link, you can simply click 'Join' in any published session in the Boulderando group. Check your e-mail to confirm the booking and if there are any problems.

    If you'd like to create new sessions, visit https://boulderando.vercel.app/sessions. When you schedule using this method, it will automatically publish the session to the group chat so anyone can join.

    These are some commands you can type here for more fine grained control:

    /help : Show this help text
    /set_user_info <userpattern> : Save your info for future scheduling (same as registration form)
    /get_user_info : Check your info
    /delete_user_info: Delete your info
    /privacy_policy : Read our Privacy Policy

    <userpattern>: first name, last name, birthday (dd.mm.yyyy), phone number, email, urban sports club number

    Your personal data is stored in our database and can be deleted at any time. When scheduling specific sessions, your data is transmitted to the corresponding Gym using the Dr. Plano booking system. By scheduling sessions you're automatically agreeing to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy of that Gym.

    Your data is not used for any other purposes. If this service is decomissioned, all data will be deleted.
